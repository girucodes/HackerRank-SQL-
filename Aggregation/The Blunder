Question: 7
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table,
but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), 
and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:
Field   | Type 
ID      |  INTEGER
NAME    |  STRING
SALARY  |  INTEGER

Note: Salary is per month.

Constraints
1000 < SALARY < 10^5

Sample Input
ID    |    NAME    |    SALARY
1     |  KRISTEEN  |    1420
2     |  ASHLEY    |    2006
3     |  JULIA     |    2210
4     |  MARIA     |    3000

Sample Output
2061

Explanation

The table below shows the salaries without zeros as they were entered by Samantha:
ID    |    NAME    |    SALARY
1     |  KRISTEEN  |    142
2     |  ASHLEY    |    26
3     |  JULIA     |    221
4     |  MARIA     |    3

Samantha computes an average salary of 98.00
The actual average salary is 2159.00

The resulting error between the two calculations is 2159.00 - 98.00 = 2061.00
Since it is equal to the integer 2061, it does not get rounded up.

    pseudocode
Approach is simple that Samantha typed zero but in reality zero were not typed like she typed 2006, but it was 26 
so we need to calculate this error_amount in avg salaries -> actual_avg_salary - miscalculated_monthly_avg_salary. 

For this we will use 
1. AVG() -> to cal avg salary in total 
2. REPLACE() -> to cal => miscalculated_monthly_avg_salary 
3. CEIL() -> returns smallest integer value. 

Now here we could have used ROUND() or FLOOR() but we didn't used it here, WHY ?
becz ROUND() and FLOOR() -> were rounding the value to highest integer.

# Breaking the code here 

-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(SALARY),0),  
-- FROM EMPLOYEES

-- 4047 

-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(REPLACE(SALARY,0,'')),0)
-- FROM EMPLOYEES

-- 1794

# with ROUND()/ FLOOR() => 4047 - 1794  was giving 2252 value 

# SOLUTION
# that's why i have used here CEIL() and it was giving -> 2253 
SELECT CEIL((AVG(SALARY) - AVG(REPLACE(SALARY,0,''))))
FROM EMPLOYEES 

# SQL ORDER OF EXECUTION
1. FROM
2. SELECT -> AVG(), REPLACE() -> CEIL()
