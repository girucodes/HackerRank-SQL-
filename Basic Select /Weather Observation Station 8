Question 
Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
FIELD   |   TYPE
ID      |   NUMBER
CITY    |  VARCHAR2(21)
STATE   |  VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N   |  NUMBER
LONG_W  |  NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

'''
    pseudocode 
We want to find those city who start and ends with vowels 
this is the filtering condition & we want both conditions to be TRUE so we will use AND operator, IN() to check multiple conditions
& DISTINCT() get only count of each value once.
