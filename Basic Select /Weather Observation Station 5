Question 
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths 
(i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, 
choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

The STATION table is described as follows:
FIELD   |   TYPE
ID      |   NUMBER
CITY    |  VARCHAR2(21)
STATE   |  VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N   |  NUMBER
LONG_W  |  NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . 
The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

'''
    pseudocode
We have to find shortest and largest city names from STATION table and if there are more than shortest or largest city we have to sort
result in alphabetical form. 

we will use LENGTH(),
ORDER BY clause to sort the columns in ASC 
and LIMITclause becze we want only 1 shortest and largest city.

# SOLUTION 
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
LIMIT 1 ; 
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT 1 ;
