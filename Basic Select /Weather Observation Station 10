Question: 15
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels.
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Input Format
The STATION table is described as follows:
FIELD   |   TYPE
ID      |   NUMBER

Now we want those city names that do not end with vowels 
we will use SUBSTR(fieldname,start,how many char to extract) - Extract a substring from a string. 
            SUBSTR(CITY,-1,1) => Extract sub string from CITY start from -1 i.e last value, Extract only 1 value 
filtering using WHERE and NOT IN(), DISTINCT().

# SOLUTION 
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY)
FROM STATION 
WHERE SUBSTR(CITY,-1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') ; 

# SQL ORDER OF EXECUTION 
1. FROM table
2. WHERE filter records
