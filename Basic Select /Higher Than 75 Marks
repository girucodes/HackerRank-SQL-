    pseudocode
We have to find those student names who scored higher than 75 marks -> condition 
and sort the result acc to their last 3 char names if they are duplicate then sort on basis of ID. 
We will use ORDER BY clause to order the column for filtered result of last 3 chars SUBSTR(NAME,-3,3) for final output.

# SOLUTION
SELECT NAME
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE MARKS > 75 
ORDER BY SUBSTR(NAME, -3,3), ID ; 

# SQL ORDER OF EXECUTION
1. FROM
2. WHERE 
3. SELECT
